Just a couple of notes:

For some reason once in a while this throws a null pointer exception but you can't see it. This comes form the API that I am using to poll the GW2API and I haven't found a fix. I recently added the source for this lib for more testing. 

If you notice that the UI is unresponsive restart the application. It may take a couple tries before it works. I hope to have this fixed soon. 

adding test comment to see if i can update with tortoise svn
